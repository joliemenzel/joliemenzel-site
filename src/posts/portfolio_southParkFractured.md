*South Park: The Fractured But Whole* is a 2.5D roleplaying game featuring tactical turn-based combat, an open world, traversal puzzles, and crafting. 

As the Narrative Lead on the game, I was responsible for translating *South Park* series creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker's vision for the game into playable experiences. This included the design of a custom dialogue system, design of the mission system, and overseeing both mission and narrative content to ensure internal cohesion and alignment with the IP. 

I lead our cross-discipline Narrative team, including writers, producers, narrative designers, and audio team members. I worked closely with our design team to develop mission and combat scenarios, as well as advise on theming for character powers, puzzle scenarios, and items. 

I wrote and designed some missions such as the Gender/Sexuality selection:


I wrote a great deal of the combat dialouge as well. 
This scene served as our E3 demo, and our first complete test of the dyanmic dialouge system:
