*Tales From the Borderlands* is an episodic adventure comedy game based on the *Borderlands* series from Gearbox. 

On *Tales From the Borderlands*, I performed various **Cinematic Design** and **Game Design** tasks. 

I did a lot of cinematics work on our **Spooky Hallway** including **navigation camera design** and **cinematics** - in other words, I choreographed the both the authored cutscenes and the camera that shows the player character while walking through the space. 

I prototyped various gameplay modes and minigames. While not all of them made it into the shipping product, some that did include:
**Loaderbot Control Scene** , in which I worked closely with our programmers to build cinematic componants to react to the player. 

I also did the initial design for Episode 3
