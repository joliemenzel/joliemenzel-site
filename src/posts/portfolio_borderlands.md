## Selected Work
### Hall of Pandoran Luminaries + Echo Eye prototyping

I was responsible for the cinematics and navigation cameras in the "Hall of Pandoran Luminaries" section of *Tales from the Borderlands* Episode 1. This area served as our main proof-of-concept for Rhys' "Echo Eye" mechanic. In this alternate 1st-person view, players can view additional details about the world and see various jokes and easter eggs. To ensure that the game retained its cinematic look, bespoke cameras were placed to ensure that the framing of the envirnment in Echo Eye mode was always well-composed. 

You can watch a playthrough of the entire scene with its Echo Eye content, here:
