*Where the Water Tastes Like Wine* is an adventure game set in a surreal version of America betweem the Great Depression era and Post-WWII era. The game had almost 40 writers contributing, making the game a kind of games writing anthology. 

As a **writer** on the project, I was responsible writing for Ray, a cowboy inspired by the work of [Edward Abbey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Abbey). 

I also **mentored** more junior writers on the project to guide them in writing for branching narratives and player feedback using the **ink** scripting system.
