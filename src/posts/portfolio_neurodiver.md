While guiding the team's story development process, I proposed the idea of a self-contained “pilot memory”: a short, playable scenario that let the team test the protagonist’s powers and core player verbs in a focused story. This approach gave the team a concrete example of how narrative and gameplay could work together, while also providing a demo that players could enjoy on its own.

For the demo, I wrote all dialogue and designed the mission flow. It is available to play free on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1293910/Read_Only_Memories_NEURODIVER/), or check out a video of it here:
