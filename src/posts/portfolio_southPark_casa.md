## Leadership & Contributions
I developed the outline and mission flow for *From Dusk Till Casa Bonita* in direct collaboration with South Park Studios, traveling to Los Angeles for writers’ rooms throughout development. To design the level’s overall flow, I researched both the South Park episode and real-world references of the Casa Bonita restaurant. (Funnily enough, a Casa Bonita level design was my original test when I applied for the job, so it was a full-circle moment to build it for real as a DLC mission.)

The DLC introduced Henrietta as a new playable party member, fully integrated into the base game through our dynamic dialogue system. Because the system was built for flexibility, adding her was seamless: she could banter and react in every context like the rest of the cast.

We also leaned more heavily on our co-dev partners at Ubisoft Osaka, who handled full areas and puzzle designs under our guidance. I visited Osaka to support their work directly, ensuring that their contributions felt authentic to the South Park IP.
