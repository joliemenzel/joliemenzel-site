Cinematic Design
Level Design
Gameplay Scripting (LUA)



*The Walking Dead: 400 Days* is a downloadable DLC special episode for *The Walking Dead: Season One*. It is set at the same time as the events of *The Walking Dead*, and follows 5 separate groups of survivors, each with their own stand-alone stories and unique gameplay. 

*400 Days* was a wonderful way for us to take a look at our successes in advancing the adventure game genre, and push further with more experimental ideas for how players could interact with our stories.  

As a **Cinematic Artist** on *The Walking Dead: 400 Days*, in addition to my responsibilities on [the first Walking Dead game]({{ collections.posts | postUrlBySlug('wd2012') | url }}), I prototyped original game mechanics using lua and our proprietary engine (the Telltale Tool). 

One of the prototypes I built was the "corn maze" gameplay for Chapter 5. You can check out a video of it, here:
