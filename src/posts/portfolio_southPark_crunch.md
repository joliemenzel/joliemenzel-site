## Leadership & Contributions
For *Bring the Crunch*, I again collaborated closely with South Park Studios in LA to build the outline and mission flow, aligning story direction with gameplay scenarios. This expansion introduced Mintberry Crunch as a new party member, fully supported by the dialogue system so that he could join the playerâ€™s party seamlessly across both the DLC and the base game.

Our team at Ubisoft Osaka handled the level and puzzle design for large sections of the DLC, and I worked onsite with them to ensure their content aligned with the mission structure and captured the tone of South Park.
