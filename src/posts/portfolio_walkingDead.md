The Walking Dead is an episodic adventure game that takes place in the same universe as Robert Kirkman's comic of the same name. Since it's release in 2012, it has received numerous accolades from a variety of publications and organizations, including Game of the Year from the Spike Video Game Awards and a BAFTA for Best Narrative. 

As a **Cinematic Artist** on *The Walking Dead*, I was responsible for:
* **Navigation camera setups** - After recieving an environment blockout from the 3D artists, I would define the player's navigation area and create cinematic navigation cameras to guide them through the space. 
* **Cutscene Setup and Layout** - I was responsible for taking the Designers' and Writers' scene designs and creating a game flow to express the intended player path through the story. This could include simply setting up cutscene files ("choreography files" - "chore" for short) and ensuring all of the basic camera and character blocking were implemented for initial testing of the scene. More ambitious scenes could involve lua scripting and highly specific setups to incorporate unique player control schemes or story logic.
