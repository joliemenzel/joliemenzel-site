## Contribution
For *South Park: Snow Day!* I was brought in by the South Park team to help close out the game, focusing on the large volume of in-game dialogue such as character quips, banter, and reactive jokes that play during combat and exploration. This also included patching up some gaps in the main script to ensure story beats connected smoothly and aligned with mission goals. My role was to capture the showâ€™s distinctive comedic voice while delivering the breadth of incidental dialogue needed to bring the world to life moment-to-moment.
