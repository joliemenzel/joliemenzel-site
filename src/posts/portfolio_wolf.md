*The Wolf Among Us* is an episodic adventure game based on Bill WIllingham's *Fables* comic book series. The game's story serves as a prequel, set twenty years before the events of *Fables*
*The Wofl Among Us* won Best Direction in a Game Cinema and received six other nominations at the 2014 National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers (NAVGTR). 

As a **Cinematic Artist** on *The Wolf Among Us*, I was responsible for:

* **Navigation camera setups** - After recieving an environment blockout from the 3D artists, I would define the player's navigation area and create cinematic navigation cameras to guide them through the space. I'm particularly fond of the Library cameras, which shows off the beautiful enviornment in a wide shot before branching off into smaller more detailed shots.

* **Puzzle Design** - I assisted our Designer in prototyping and iterating on some of the more involved investigation puzzles in the game. One of those was Toad's Apartment in Episode 1:

* **Level design** - On some of the later episodes, I also took on some level design work. I greyboxed the Bloody mary level, working between Maya and our proproietry engine. This space in particular had a unique vertical layout that we wanted to prove both the navigation and camera work out for before handing it off to art
