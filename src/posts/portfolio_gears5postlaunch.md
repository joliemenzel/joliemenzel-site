## Leadership & Contributions
Across Operations 3 through 8, I led the narrative team supporting post-launch content for Gears 5. This included reviewing combat dialogue sets for both new and legacy characters, adapting lines to fit new game modes under tight timelines, and ensuring consistency across more than a dozen characters and variants added during this period.

I personally wrote combat dialogue for Ko-Fi Kingston in the WWE crossover pack, while mentoring mid-level designers who handled Big E and Xavier Woods. To balance authority with collaboration, I set up a peer review system that gave everyone equal footing while still allowing me oversight on overall quality. I also coordinated closely with our lore master to review new character skins and ensure dialogue remained true to each characterâ€™s identity.

The role required equal parts creative writing, systems-level thinking, and leadership, helping the team hit ambitious release goals while keeping the Gears tone sharp and authentic.
